Weaving-Tablet version 0.8.5

Weaving::Tablet provides methods for editing tablet weaving patterns.

Weaving::Tablet::Tk provides a GUI for mouse-based editing of these
patterns.

The pattern files are in a human readable (or at least comprehensible)
format. 

It's still somewhat crude and sluggish, but it works.
